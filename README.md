# bundled-HFK
A `C++` library for calculating knot Floer homology via Ozsváth and Szabó's bordered approach.

This code was written during my (Isaac Ren) stay at Inria Sophia Antipolis-Méditerranée, doing an internship under the suprvision of Clément Maria, from March to August 2021.

Note on the license: this code uses bits of Ozsváth and Szabó's program [`ComputeHFKv2`](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~szabo/HFKcalc.html). They did not specify a license for distribution, so I chose to distribute this code under GPL v3.0. I have contacted the original authors, and when they reply, I will update the license accordingly.
